                    <p>Life at NIFT is a perfect mix of creativity, learning, and fun. It provides practical knowledge of the basics of design and hands-on experience, not just theory. By the time I graduated, I had completed three internships during my 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years with sen sen design, law & kennith, Ogilvy, and others. NIFT campus life is vibrant, with lots of clubs. I was also part of the drama and art clubs, where I produced three plays, all written by me, on different social issues.</p>
