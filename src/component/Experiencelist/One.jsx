                <p className='font-[200] text-[15px]'>Currently, I lead the UX team at <strong>Biz2Credit</strong>, a fintech company providing <strong>loan management systems</strong>  to clients in the USA, the Middle East, and India. My focus is primarily on the U.S. market, but I ensure that l deliver<strong> high-quality, consistent solutions globally.</strong><br></br><br></br> 

I manage a team of<strong> 4 designers</strong> in India 3 in USA and collaborate closely with <strong>22 product</strong>  managers and <strong>8 implementation managers</strong>, many of whom are based in our New York office, including my manager, Aaron.<br></br><br></br>


One of my key responsibilities is turning complex business requirements into user-friendly and creative solutions that centre around the user need.<br></br><br></br>

I closely monitor our <strong> core product</strong> to identify gaps and areas for improvement, constantly seeking opportunities to <strong>enhance the user experience.</strong><br></br><br></br> 

I own the <strong> design system</strong>, ensuring <strong> consistency across products</strong> and approving or adding new components or variants as needed.<br></br><br></br> 


A key part of this process involves <strong>cross-functional collaboration</strong> —I regularly engage with <strong>development teams, QA, product managers, stakeholders, front-end engineers, and data scientists</strong>  to ensure alignment and seamless integration of design solutions. This collaboration is crucial for transforming complex business requirements into intuitive, <strong>user-friendly products</strong>  that meet both technical and business objectives.<br></br><br></br>

I also introduced a <strong> UX QA process</strong> to our agile workflow, which wasn’t part of our process earlier, ensuring that what we design is implemented with precision.<br></br><br></br> 

<strong>Time management</strong> is crucial in my role, and I make sure that all designs are completed well ahead of development timelines.<br></br><br></br>


Our team regularly holds<strong>usability sessions</strong>  to align on <strong>design strategies</strong>  and share insights. Conducted comprehensive user research to <strong>understand user needs, behaviours, and pain points</strong> within the fintech industry. Utilised various research methods such as <strong>user interviews, usability testing, and competitive analysis</strong>  to gather insights and inform design decisions.<br></br><br></br> Analysed user data, feedback, and metrics to drive continuous improvement and enhance user experiences.
